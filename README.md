# Hello-World
My first repository. Sincerely.

When I came home from work today, my big plan for my evening hours was to do onerous chores and then reward myself for a "job well done" with frozen pizza and re-runs. Enter a sarcastic yay here. Then I was blindsided by GitHub. My evening suddenly became much cooler. Yay! No sarcasm this time. Embarking on a coding adventure with as little experience as I possess (I doubt creating a text-based choose-your-own-adventure Star Trek game using Basic when I was in high school has any relevance to current cyberspace challenges) is something akin to falling down a rabbit hole into Wonderland, minus the giant caterpillar smoking a hookah and an ethereal cat with a wicked grin, obviously, but I'm intrigued. Where will this journey take me? Will it be something I fiddle with for a day or two and then forget about? Will it divert me onto a new life path, complete with a more rewarding career and that house with an indoor pool and bay views that I've been dreaming about? Will it drive me madder than a hatter at an unbirthday party? Lets find out! 

The takeaway: I don't know the first thing about coding. I don't know what I'm doing here. Expect mistakes. I might even learn something from them. 

Well, I'm off to see what strange things this curious world will show me. 

Hello world!
